Question 1: What module content you have explored this week?

This week I focused primarily on thoroughly studying the learning modules provided in the course. I completed:

-- Module 1 (Project Planning): Learned wireframing and ERD creation
-- Module 2 (Entity Framework): Practiced code-first migrations
-- Previewed Module 3 LINQ materials to prepare for upcoming work


Question 2: What have you worked on regarding your passion project?

For my School Management System, I've:
Created simple wireframes (student registration form, admin/manager dashboard)

Built these database tables using EF Core:

-- Students (ID, Name, Email)
-- Courses (ID, Name, Credits)
-- Enrollments (StudentID, CourseID)

Set up GitHub repository with initial ASP.NET Core MVC project


Question 3: Are there any issues impacting your project timeline? 
(NOTE: If you would like assistance; get in touch with your instructor!)

No blockers yet. My next immediate tasks are:

-- Add validation to student registration form
-- Create basic course enrollment function
-- Implement admin view to see all enrollments

Where I Might Need Help:

Adding user authentication later (will review ASP.NET Core Identity)
Optimizing LINQ queries for better performance
